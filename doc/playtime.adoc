== Notes for later

=== High buffer sizes

* Mention in "troubleshooting" section that one has to be careful with high buffer sizes
* At the moment, Playtime 2 is a live instrument, so it's intended to be used with buffer sizes that don't introduce more than 10 or 11ms of latency.
* When using it with higher buffer sizes, the following effects may occur:
** When triggering audio clips on a track that contains FX which introduces latency, the audio will be delayed
** Triggering MIDI clips will lead to unpleasant delays
* Behavior with high buffer sizes might improve in future
